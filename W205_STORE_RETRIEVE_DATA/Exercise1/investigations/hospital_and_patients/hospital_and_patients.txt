I examined correlation if timely/effectiveness, readmission, and mortality scores have correlation with survey score.
It turns out correlation is quite weak as shown below. Intuition was at least one of the scores has correlate with survey score
because I thought poor quality of care leads to poor survey score.

Correlation between Timely/Effectiveness and Survey

To understand what is going on, I investigated further by looking at the most variable measures that I identified in the prior investigation.
A measure has higher variability is a measure that one hospital operates with much better quality than another hospital. 
In other words, which hospital to choose matters for a patient if she takes that measure. 
This type of measures might drive a survey score more than measures with low variability (most hospitals provide same quality for these measures).

I discovered scores for measures ED_1b, ED_2b and OP_18b have high correlation with survey score respectively.
The higher scores for these measures are (the worse quality of these measures are), the lower survey score is.
Conclusion of this investigation is that timeliness of emergency care is the biggest driver of the survey score.
